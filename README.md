🧠✨ Emotional Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
Welcome to Emotional Sentiment Analysis, where we explore the power of machine learning in understanding human emotions through text! This repository contains a Python notebook, emotional_sentiment.ipynb, that investigates various ML techniques applied to sentiment analysis.

🚀 What's Inside?
🔹 Jupyter Notebook: Dive into emotional_sentiment.ipynb to explore different models and their performance.
🔹 Dataset Insights: While the actual training and testing data are not included due to privacy concerns, you can check out the distribution of text sample lengths in training_testing_dist_figure.png.
🔹 Reproducibility: Want to compare your dataset with the original? The script training_testing_fig.py is available so you can generate the distribution figure yourself.
🔹 Kaggle Results: Some of our models were put to the test in a private Kaggle competition! Check out Emotional_Sentiment_Kaggle_Results.png to see how they performed.

📊 How to Use
1️⃣ Clone the repo and open emotional_sentiment.ipynb in Jupyter.
2️⃣ Train and test different models on your own dataset.
3️⃣ Use training_testing_fig.py to visualize your dataset's distribution.
4️⃣ See what results you can get on your own testing set.
